### Driver test process
1. create LinkedList, Task, date, ExpiredDate object with valid, and invalid input
2. add more task
3. remove single task
4. count all task
5. revise task and date
5. get task by condition
6. remove task by condition
7. print out task by condition
8. print in period task
9. change date on task
10. count task by MAP and Filter method
11. get tasks and create Linked List from reading file
12. compare tasks and get higher priority one
13. print similar content task
14. implement MAP to convert linked list to cotent only linked list
15. remove all task
16. print all task

### Writing assignment

:star:  **Weekly report**

This week is focusing on the provided code analysis, modifying given codes and adding appropriate methods to implement some purpose and functionality. The big takeaway for me is learning how to understand a program when I first time see it. The UML is a great point to start with, draw a UML chat along with reading each code file is very helpful to quickly catch up the whole structure of the program. Then following the UML to read the code line by line with the requirements file is the way how I fully understood the whole program. With a solid understanding then I could start work on extensions and modifications.
Another learning of this week is about the hierarchy tree structure, it's really useful when we try to operate and manage an organization structure and mainly focus on relationship manipulation. Also, the implementation of tree structure design is similar to the linked list. Build a structure framework then add relevant content to each node.

In my program, I also apply extension as;
- Use driver and JUnit testing
- Additional functions
	- time period filter 
	- similar task checking instead of exactly same task checking
 	- implements count function by both of fold and filter method
- Use more ENUM with more complex elements
- Create clear driver for testing
- More design elements, ToDoListTools, Status ENUM, Multiple interfaces
- Read / Write file with appropriate data format, could generate LinkedList automatically from reading file
- Code defensively for most of methods
- Use interface over abstract and inheritance for future extension
