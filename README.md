### Driver test process
1. create employees, organization
2. add employees to organization
3. check total number of employees
4. get each employee information
5. create a list with employee's name only
6. filter employee with certain given name
7. check employee within given salary range

### Writing assignment

:star:  **Weekly report**

This week is focusing on the provided code analysis, modifying given codes and adding appropriate methods to implement some purpose and functionality. The big takeaway for me is learning how to understand a program when I first time see it. The UML is a great point to start with, draw a UML chat along with reading each code file is very helpful to quickly catch up the whole structure of the program. Then following the UML to read the code line by line with the requirements file is the way how I fully understood the whole program. With a solid understanding then I could start work on extensions and modifications.
Another learning of this week is about the hierarchy tree structure, it's really useful when we try to operate and manage an organization structure and mainly focus on relationship manipulation. Also, the implementation of tree structure design is similar to the linked list. Build a structure framework then add relevant content to each node.

In my program, I also apply extension as;
- Use driver and JUnit testing
- Additional functions
	- check employee within given salary range
 	- get percentage of Male employee out of all employees
- Extra task
	- filter by employee's name
